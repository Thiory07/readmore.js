# readmore.js
Dealing with a problem on readmore widgets decide to make my own, I need it to fit on a div container that has a lot of different content tags inside (a,i,b,p,strong).

## Know issue
- changing html content will eventually destroy the event listeners on any links
- jquery each is heavy and low performace
